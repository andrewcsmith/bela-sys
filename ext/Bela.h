 * which incorporates stereo audio with 8x, 16-bit analog inputs and outputs.
 *
 * Bela is based on the Xenomai real-time Linux extensions (http://xenomai.org) and

/**
 * \brief Create a new auxiliary task.
 *
 * This function creates a new auxiliary task which, when scheduled, runs the function specified
 * in the first argument. Note that the task does not run until scheduleAuxiliaryTask() is called.
 * Auxiliary tasks should be created in `setup()` and never in `render()` itself.
 *
 * The second argument specifies the real-time priority. Valid values are between 0
 * and 99, and usually should be lower than \ref BELA_AUDIO_PRIORITY. Tasks with higher priority always
 * preempt tasks with lower priority.
 *
 * \param callback Function which will be called each time the auxiliary task is scheduled, unless it is already running.
 * \param priority Xenomai priority level at which the task should run.
 * \param name Name for this task, which should be unique system-wide (no other running program should use this name).
 * \param arg The argument passed to the callback function.

/**
 * \brief Run an auxiliary task which has previously been created.
 *
 * This function will schedule an auxiliary task to run. 
 *
 * If the task is already running, calling this function has no effect.
 * If the task is not running (e.g.: a previous invocation has returned), the \b callback function defined
 * in Bela_createAuxiliaryTask() will be called and it will be passed the \b arg pointer as its only parameter.
 *
 * This function is typically called from render() to start a lower-priority task. The function
 * will not run immediately, but only once any active higher priority tasks have finished.
 *
 * \param task Task to schedule for running.
 * \return 0 if the task was successfully scheduled, a positive error number otherwise. The most frequent error will be EBUSY, if the task was still running as a consequence of a previous call.
